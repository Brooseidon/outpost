This project is a long-range Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity library that is intended to work with LoRa-based devices on either 915 MHz or 433 MHz, with additional information coming soon.

You can find the project board [here](https://github.com/users/gideontong/projects/1) with the current to-do list. You can also submit PRs or start issues if there are any features you want to add or if there are bugs.

Have additional feedback for us? Feel free to email me at the email linked in [my bio](https://github.com/gideontong). This project was created by Gideon Tong, Brian Lam, Kenneth, and Jay Sun with the additional help of many mentors.
