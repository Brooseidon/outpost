The logistical process of gaining access to the roof of Geisel Library, one of the tallest buildings at UC San Diego was more complicated than we initially imagined, as we thought we could simply walk up there. It turns out this is not the case and that it requires special permission from the head of security in order to do such a thing.

We wanted to place a transceiver on the roof of this building because we believed that we would have an easier time testing the project this way, as we could demonstrate different aspects of the project, like the ability to communicate over long distances given an adequate base station, as well as the resilience of the signal when communications are weak.

By talking over these issues and answering the questions that the administration raised up, we were able to gain access to the roof of Geisel Library and will be proceeding with our testing procedure. Thank you to those who have helped us!
