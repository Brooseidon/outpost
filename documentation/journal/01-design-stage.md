# Outpost Journal: Design Stage

This project was originally spawned as an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), UC San Diego (UCSD) branch quarterly project (QP++). Although the original members were Gideon Tong, Brian Lam, `<redacted>`, and Jay Sun, `<redacted>` eventually left to go work for another project instead, leaving us with only Gideon Tong, Brian Lam, and Jay Sun.

### Summary

* We were assigned Paul Pan as our mentor
* Brainstormed some ideas for possible project setup

### Journal

On Saturday, October 12, 2019, we were assigned Paul Pan as our mentor, who has experience in software deign. He is likely unable to help us with anything related to hardware, and as we have a theoretically hardware-based design, we do not expect to need to ask him for much help. In addition, we moved to Slack for communication, rather than using SMS.

Thus, this marks the start date of this project. We decided that our project would be wireless long-range telecommunications, and we would attempt to make it feasible for many devices (hence, Internet of Things) as well as cheap.

We drafted out a design and received our parts today. The design should incorporate not only functionality (as is the minimum for a *minimum* viable product), but also usability from a user or developer standpoint as well as accessibility for those with disabilities. However, we must first consider the functionality before we can think about incorporating "nice-to-have" features.

We tested all of the parts we recieved and ensured they were in working order, using both funding we recieved from IEEE, parts curated from IEEE project stock, as well as personal stock owned by Gideon Tong. The majority of parts were either purchased with funding or used from stock already owned by individual project members (specifically Gideon Tong).

### Closing Thoughts

We feel confident that we will be able to achieve the goals outlined in this document and related project files. Our organization, confidence, and technical ability will lend itself to help us achieve such goals and we will ensure that our progress is not hampered even in the case of emergencies or other setbacks that may prove to be an impediment to our progress.
