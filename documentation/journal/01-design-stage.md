# Outpost Journal: Design Stage

This project was originally spawned as an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), UC San Diego (UCSD) branch quarterly project (QP++). Although the original members were Gideon Tong, Brian Lam, Kenneth Chen, and Jay Sun, Kenneth Chen eventually left to go work for another project instead, leaving us with only Gideon Tong, Brian Lam, and Jay Sun.

#### Summary

* We were assigned Paul Pan as our mentor
* Brainstormed some ideas for possible project setup

#### Journal

We were assigned Paul Pan as our mentor, who has experience in software deign. He is likely unable to help us with anything related to hardware, and as we have a theoretically hardware-based design, we do not expect to need to ask him for much help. In addition, we moved to Slack for communication, rather than using SMS.

In addition, we decided that our project would be wireless long-range telecommunications, and we would attempt to make it feasible for many devices (hence, Internet of Things) as well as cheap.
